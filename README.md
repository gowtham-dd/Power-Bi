# Power BI Report: Student Data Analysis

## Overview
This Power BI report provides an analysis of student data using interactive visualizations, including bar graphs, a line graph, a card for key metrics, and a filter for enhanced exploration. The report is designed to offer insights into student performance across various dimensions such as subjects, demographics, and overall trends.

## Features

### Visualizations
1. **Bar Graphs**:
   - **Subject-wise Marks**: Displays the distribution of marks across different subjects for all students.
   - **Class Performance**: Compares the average performance of different classes.
   - **City-wise Distribution**: Shows the number of students from each city.

2. **Line Graph**:
   - **Trend Analysis**: Tracks the overall performance trend over time or across age groups.

3. **Card**:
   - **Key Metric**: Highlights an important summary statistic, such as the highest average score, total number of students, or best-performing subject.

4. **Filter**:
   - Enables users to explore data dynamically by filtering based on:
     - Class
